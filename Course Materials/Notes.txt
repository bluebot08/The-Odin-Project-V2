1.1 Command Line Basics
    That black screen or window is the command line interface (CLI).

    Before we do anything, take a look at the following text: $ whoami This is a terminal command because it begins with a $. 
    The $ is saying “Hey! Enter what follows in your terminal.” This means that we must exclude the $ when entering any command.
    In the example above, we would only enter whoami in our terminal. 
    This is a common indicator so make sure that you aren’t entering $ before a command.

1.2 HTML
    You can think of elements as containers for content. 
    The opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the element contains. 
    The browser can then use that information to determine how it should interpret and format the content.

    There are some HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. 
    These elements often look like this: <br /> or <img/>, 
    but some can also be used without the closing forward slash such as <br> or <img>. 
    These are known as self-closing tags or empty elements because they don’t wrap any content.

    Using the correct elements for content is called semantic HTML.
